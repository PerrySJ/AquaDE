/* Somewhere to run a shader that is not a screen.
 *
 * The room is a signed distance field marched once per pixel, which is the
 * workload graphics hardware exists for -- and AquaDE has been doing it on
 * five CPU threads because that is where the scene is written. This is the
 * other end of that: an offscreen GLES context, a fragment program, and a
 * float buffer to read the answer back out of.
 *
 * Deliberately not tied to the compositor's own renderer. The bake happens
 * on a worker thread before there is anything on screen, it happens in the
 * preview tool where there is no compositor at all, and it must keep
 * working when the session is running on a different device from the one
 * doing the arithmetic.
 *
 * Asks for no more than GLES 3.0 and a float colour buffer (32F, or 16F
 * where that is all there is), because this has to run on whatever the
 * machine turns out to have.
 *
 *   DESK_NO_GPU=1      never open one: the CPU tracer does everything
 *   DESK_GPU_NODE=path the render node to try first
 *   DESK_GPU_HALF=1    render to 16F even where 32F is there */
