/* Playing the desk's sounds.
 *
 * The sounds are made once (sfx.c), a few of each, and mixed here on a
 * thread of their own: each time one is played it is one of its variants,
 * pitched a shade up or down and a shade louder or softer, and placed left
 * or right where the thing that made it is on the screen.
 *
 * The mix goes, in order of preference, to
 *   - the sound server, through PulseAudio's client library -- which
 *     PipeWire answers as well (built in when libpulse is there). A few
 *     streams ("lanes"), a new sound going into one holding nothing but
 *     silence, just ahead of where the server is reading, rather than
 *     behind what it holds (see the lanes, below). Kept running while
 *     somebody is at the desk; corked once nobody has been for a few
 *     seconds and there is nothing to play, so an idle desk costs the
 *     server nothing and lets the card sleep.
 *   - ALSA's default device, the library loaded only if it is there (no
 *     need of its headers to build, or of it at all to run), opened when
 *     there is something to play and closed again after a pause.
 *   - nowhere.
 * DESK_SOUND=off|pulse|alsa|file:PATH chooses; file: writes what would
 * have been heard, in real time, to a WAV -- for tests, without a sound
 * on anybody's speakers.
 *
 * A sound can be asked for ahead of time, to be heard at a moment (the
 * drawer reaching its stop): it is put out early by as long as the way to
 * the speakers takes -- the server says how long its buffers and the
 * card's are -- and a sound for a motion is cut to end as the motion is
 * seen to. DESK_SOUND_DEBUG=1 logs, for every sound, how long after it
 * was played it is heard and against when it was wanted, by the server's
 * own clock. */
